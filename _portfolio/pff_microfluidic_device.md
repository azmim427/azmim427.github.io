###### Designed by Mazyar Azmi

## Project description

* Microfluidic device for pinched flow fractionation
* Mold printed out of clear resin
* Cast in PDMS and sealed with glass slide
* Meant for separating particles that are 165 microns and 550 microns in size
* **Microfluidic Devices:** 
* **Pinched flow fractionation:** This device works by the mechanism known as pinched flow fractionation, or PFF, to separate out particles of different sizes from a mixture.
