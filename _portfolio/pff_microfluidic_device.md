###### Designed by Mazyar Azmi

## Project description

* Microfluidic device for pinched flow fractionation
* Mold printed out of clear resin and coated in parylene
* Cast in PDMS and sealed with glass slide
* Meant for separating particles that are 165 microns and 550 microns in size
* **Microfluidic Devices:** 
* **Pinched flow fractionation:** This device works by the mechanism known as pinched flow fractionation, or PFF, to separate out particles of different sizes from a mixture.
* **Instructions to build:**
  * Start by resin printing the mold. This should be printed flat, i.e. the bottom surface should be parallel to the build plate so there are no layer lines on the surface.
  * Next, post process the mold while being careful not to touch or disturb the inside surface. Remove support material after 60 second cure.
  * Next, coat the print with 2 grams of parylene-C.
  * Pour PDMS into mold, degas in vacuum, and cure in oven before demolding.
  * Finally, bond PDMS device to glass microscope slide.,
